{- Note [Emulated ledger]

In the real cardano node, there two types of validation: Transaction validation
(performed when a transaction is first added to the mempool) and block
validation (performed when a block is created by the local node or received
from a peer).

Transaction validation runs the Plutus scripts, checks cryptographic
signatures, balances, existence of transaction inputs and so forth. This is
where the ledger state is updated. Block validation performs other checks
related to the consensus algorithm.

Networking and consensus issues are not part of the emulator's scope. We only
care about transaction validation here, so we don't have to worry about block
validation.

The decision to leave out block validation and consensus-related concerns has
the following implications:

1. We can represent blocks as simple lists-of-transactions
2. We can modify time (the slot number) and ledger parameters as we wish,
   without having to post transactions that modify them.

There are also some limitations of the emulator's functionality that could be
addressed by extending the emulator, without having to bring in the full block
validating machinery.

* We cannot represent different eras - everything is 'AlonzoEra'.
* There is no handling of epoch boundaries, rewards, etc.
* The block size is unlimited - we simply take all transactions from the
  mempool when we make a block. There is however a limit on the size of
  individual transactions.
* We use the standard ledger cryptography everywhere ('StandardCrypto').
  This could be replaced by "NoCrypto" for faster validation.
